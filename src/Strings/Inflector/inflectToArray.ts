/**

 * @param string The string to be split into an array
 * @param intelligentSplitting The default splitter is rather dumb when it comes to edge cases like  IP, URL, and so on,
 *                            because it will split them like I, P and U, R, L but stuff like HandMeAMango
 *                            on the other hand will be correctly splitted like: hand, me, a, mango.
 *                            If you set this to true, those edge cases will be handled.
 *                            Problems might occure when stuff like "ThisIsFAQandMore" is given,
 *                            because the camelCase is broken the result will be: this is fa qand more.
